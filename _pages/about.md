Sishen YUAN is a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electronic Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by [Prof. Hongliang REN](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/professors/prof-ren-hongliang) and [Prof. Max Qinghu MENG](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/emeritus-professors/prof-qing-hu-max-meng). Previously, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in 2018. I received my Master's degree in Mechatronic Engineering, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Shuang SONG and Prof. Jiaole WANG. During my academic journey, I have had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed researchers including Prof. Wu YUAN, Prof. Shing Shin CHENG, and Prof. Jun LIU.

My research focuses on the intersection of robotic systems, AI, and translational biomedical engineering, with a particular interest in advancing optorobotics and surgical capsule robotics. I am passionate about enhancing human-robot collaboration in minimally invasive procedures, real-time decision-making in complex surgical environments, and medical image-guided interventions. Recently, my work has concentrated on multimodal learning for vision-language understanding and robotic skill assessment, driving innovation in surgical robotics and biomedical applications.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
