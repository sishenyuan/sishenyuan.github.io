Sishen YUAN is a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electronic Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by [Prof. Hongliang REN](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/professors/prof-ren-hongliang) and [Prof. Max Qinghu MENG](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/emeritus-professors/prof-qing-hu-max-meng). Previously, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in 2018. I received my Master's degree in Mechatronic Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in 2021, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Shuang SONG and Prof. Jiaole WANG. During my academic journey, I have had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed researchers including Prof. Wu YUAN, Prof. Shing Shin CHENG, and Prof. Jun LIU.

My research focuses on the intersection of robotic systems, AI, and translational biomedical engineering, with a particular interest in advancing optorobotics and surgical capsule robotics. I am passionate about enhancing human-robot collaboration in minimally invasive procedures, real-time decision-making in complex surgical environments, and medical image-guided interventions.
